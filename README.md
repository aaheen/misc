# [Sum Square Difference](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
```math
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
```
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
```math
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
```
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $`3025 - 385 = 2640`$.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
```math
(\sum{n=1}^100)^2  -  \sum_{n=1}^100 n^2
```
